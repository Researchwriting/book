...
Topic 15: Summary and Reflection
```

### 2. Expands Each Topic (4 subsections each)

  → 1.1 What are surveys
  → 1.2 When to use surveys
  → 1.3 Strengths and limitations
  → 1.4 African context examples
```

### 3. Writes Full Content

- Total: ~40,000 words per section

### 4. Includes Visuals

- Tables (3-5 per section)
- All with detailed explanations

### 5. Combines Everything
